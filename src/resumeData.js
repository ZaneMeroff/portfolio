  bioDescription: "My name is Zachary Nemeroff, and I’m an enthusiastic JavaScript developer and graduate of the front end program at Turing School of Software & Design. I’m passionate about test driven development and object-oriented programming using agile workflow processes. At Turing I focused on building applications using REST APIs with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, and React Native while creating comprehensive unit testing suites. Recently, I have focused my energy to learn Vue.js and its seemingly infinite modern applications. I’m constantly seeking opportunities that present unique challenges calling for creative solutions, so I may expand my knowledge and grow technical skills outside of my comfort zone. If you're up for a challenge, try the Mr. Simon game I created below!",
