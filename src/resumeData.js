  bioDescription: "My name is Zachary Nemeroff, and I’m an energetic JavaScript developer and recent graduate of the front end program at Turing School of Software & Design. I’m passionate about test driven development and object-oriented programming using agile workflow processes. At Turing I focused on building applications using REST APIs with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, React, and React Native while creating comprehensive unit testing suites. I’m seeking a career opportunity that presents unique challenges calling for creative solutions, so I may expand my knowledge and grow new technical skills outside of my comfort zone. If you're up for a challenge, try the Mr. Simon game I created below!",
