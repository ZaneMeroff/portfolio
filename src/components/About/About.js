        <h2>Greetings!</h2>
        <p>
           My name is Zachary Nemeroff, and Iâ€™m a front end software developer and recent graduate of the Turing School of Software and Design. I have an affinity for test driven development and object-oriented programming with agile workflow processes. At Turing I focused on building applications using REST APIs with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, React, and React Native, using Git/GitHub for version control and creating comprehensive unit testing suites. I'm currently seeking a new career opportunity where I will be challenged daily, so that I may expand my knowledge and grow my technical skills. If <em>you're</em> up for a challenge, try the Mr. Simon Game I created below!
